# Download-Organizer
Imagine your files and pictures are all scatter on your desktop and you want to sort out which things you need on your laptop/desktop. This project's purpose is to organize Download folders such as images, text, video, and other necessary files.
The code basically moves around depending on the ending address of the file. 

For Example:
(C:\\Users\\leagu\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Download_Organization\doctor.png)
According to this file address, this image of a doctor will be moved to your specific desktop file. 

This is a Python beginner's idea project, so if you want to mess around with the code, be sure to take the downloads_organizer.py file and mess around with it or adjust your expectations accordingly.


# Requirements
The script needs to be installed from Python3 and run only any IDE of your choice... The code was created on PyCharm (anaconda). This does not mean to use only PyCharm to use this code!

# How to use
Change the downloads_path, organize_folder, or any specific folder in the code and match it to your computer's address.

# Keep Cautious
Please note that this code is beginner, and I am allowing anyone to mess around with it, so you could adjust and put it onto your portfolio. This simple automation could easily adjust your files when done correctly.

# Important
Depending on the size of your (Downloads-) folder it can take quite a while for all the files to move/organize during the first run. Don't terminate the script while it's running because that may corrupt some of your files.
